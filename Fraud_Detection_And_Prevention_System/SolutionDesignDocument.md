# Fraud Detection And Prevention System
## Problem statement
Develop an advanced fraud detection and prevention system to
safeguard digital transactions and protect consumers and financial institutions
from fraudulent activities. Utilize machine learning algorithms and behavioral
analytics to analyze transaction data in real time, identify suspicious patterns,
and flag potentially fraudulent transactions for further investigation. Implement
multi-factor authentication mechanisms, anomaly detection techniques, and
transaction monitoring algorithms to enhance security and mitigate fraud
risks across various payment channels, including mobile payments, online
transactions, and peer-to-peer transfers. The solution should offer a seamless
user experience while maintaining robust security measures to combat
evolving fraud threats in the digital payments landscape.

## Proposed System Overview
The proposed system aims to:
1. Analyze transaction data in real-time and flag suspicious transactions.
2. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication(MFA).
3. Monitor transactions from multiple channels.
4. Seamless user experience.

## Proposed Solution:

An anti-fraud management system (AFMS) comprising fraud auditing, prevention, and detection tasks. Implementing real-time capabilities with streaming analytics technologies for these transactional and analytical workloads.

## 1. Real-Time Data Processing

> Real-time data processing is the execution of data in a short time, providing near instantaneous output. Examples of real-time data processing systems are bank ATMs, traffic control systems, and computer systems such as PCs, and mobile devices.
Real-time data processing is also called stream processing because of the continuous stream of input data required to yield output.

When you are trying to make any payment or withdraw money using a credit card the request is sent to your bank and the bank checks your pin and other details and determines whether to process the transaction or not. There is a time window between the request being sent and processing the request, during this very small time window we want to apply many operations:

#### a. Ingest: 
Collecting processing data from various sources in real or near-real time. Streaming data is a type of real-time data ingestion. In our case, the ingested data is the information regarding the transaction such as transaction number, credit card number, amount, device, geolocation, etc.

#### b. Enrich: 
Data Enrichment is the process of merging and adding either first-party or third-party data to a dataset you're already working with. In our case, we provide context, customer details, merchant details, and real-time features such as distance from home, etc to enrich the ingested data.

#### c. Transform:
In this operation, we do feature engineering to determine which features to use by performing normalizations, filtering, scaling, etc.

#### d. Predict:
This is where we have our trained machine learning model deployed in real-time and get fraud probability prediction.

#### e. Act:
After applying business rules and emerging fraud checks it gives output whether to accept or decline the transaction.

### Real-time event streaming in action:
To perform the above operations we will require an efficient event streaming pipeline. Stream processing is the foundation for implementing fraud detection and prevention while the data is in motion (and relevant) instead of just storing data at rest for analytics (too late).
