# Fraud Detection And Prevention System

## Problem statement

Develop an advanced fraud detection and prevention system to
safeguard digital transactions and protect consumers and financial institutions
from fraudulent activities. Utilize machine learning algorithms and behavioral
analytics to analyze transaction data in real-time, identify suspicious patterns,
and flag potentially fraudulent transactions for further investigation. Implement
multi-factor authentication mechanisms, anomaly detection techniques, and
transaction monitoring algorithms to enhance security and mitigate fraud
risks across various payment channels, including mobile payments, online
transactions, and peer-to-peer transfers. The solution should offer a seamless
user experience while maintaining robust security measures to combat
evolving fraud threats in the digital payments landscape.
